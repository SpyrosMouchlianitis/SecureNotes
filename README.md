# SecureNotes
This app is a simple idea used to secure notes with Fingerprint Authentication. It can also be referred to as Keyless Authentication, unlike old ways where it needed passwords to be entered. Though it doesn’t require any user registration, only the owner of the device can access it. This App can be used to save private notes or personal data.

The data will be stored in the device using SQLite. And for the front end and functioning, the platform of Android Studio was used. This app needs biometric authentication in the device; else it can’t be used.

Here the users can add new notes, edit the old notes, and delete those that are no more required. As biometric authentication is considered as the highest level of security of any Phone, this app would be a good idea to store personal information.
